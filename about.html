                <p class="para-about">
                    Hi, my name is Marco Spanhaak, born in The Netherlands, but live together with my 'Sambo' Ella in Sweden.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm a proud father of a beautiful daughter who studies communication in The Netherlands. She will be amazing in her field of work after her study. 
                    <br><br>
                    We have three dogs here in Sweden, all of them are adopted dogs from Spain. Because they are adopted, they need special attention from us since they have been mistreated by their previous owner. We are happy to be able to provide them a new loving home.
                    <br><br>
                    In the next paragraph i'll be elaborating a bit more about why this website exists. Feel free to drop a mail (see the <a href="contact.html" >contact page</a>) or give me a call if you would like to talk with me.

                Who am I
            </p>
            <p class="para-about">
                If you are interested to learn about my professional side, please click the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcospanhaak/" target="_blank">link</a> to my LinkedIN page or you can also download my CV here.
                <br><br>
                The main reason why I've built this website is because LinkedIN might not be the best platform to explain in which areas I'm interested in and show actually what kind of projects I have been working on.
                <br><br>
                In a nut shell, I'm a tech guy who is able to communicate a message. I'm very interested in technology in general and like to chat about it. This without losing eye-contact with my surroundings and stakeholders. Because you can learn or master all the technology in the world, but if you cannot understand the need of your stakeholders or translate that technology into features, you are basically toast, right? :-)

                    What do I like
                </p>
                <p class="para-about">
                    Red wine, fish, cooking, baking lots of stuff :-)
                    <br><br>
                    I really like to sit down with friends and enjoy food, chats, music and laugh about the silly things in life. Also laugh about the more tougher part of life as well. Humor goes a long way in dealing with a lot of topics.
                    <br><br>
                    But on the enterprise side I like a combination of organisation and technology. I've got tech skills but I'm also used (and like) to manage a team as well. 
                    <br><br>
                    In the IT domain, I've 'grown up' in the IT Service Management area. Mostly working with Infrastructure, Discovery, Data imports, Data Wrangling, Data Engineering and coding.

                    What makes me happy
                </p>
                <p class="para-about">
                    Red wine, fish, cooking, baking lots of stuff. Oh hang on, I already said that. :-)
                    <br><br>
                    Learning, doing MOOG's, on EDX or Coursera. But also coding, building webapps and using modern technology and reap its benefits. 
                    I'm truly happy when I've solved a puzzle (I call all kinds of challenges puzzles).
                    <br><br>
                    I actually like to fiddle along with API's, NodeJS, JS, Python, HTML, CSS, CI/CD and lots of other cutting edge tech stuff....
